## Mamawmail Research Initiative – License Overview

The Mamawmail Research Initiative is a combined effort of theoretical research,  
system architecture design, and practical software implementation.  

It is organized into three connected repositories, each with its own license.  
The whitepapers provide the **research foundation** and theoretical framework,  
while the implementation repository translates those ideas into a working system.

# UPDATE SUMMARY

**June 20, 2025**  

## Abstract  

MAMAWMAIL is a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging protocol that enables encrypted communication without relying on central servers or permanent infrastructure. Messages are distributed using a fractal propagation model, where packets branch through nearby devices and self-delete upon successful forwarding or delivery. The system integrates lightweight routing intelligence and prepares for optional AI-based learning, allowing it to optimize delivery paths over time.

MAMAWMAIL is designed to be censorship-resistant, infrastructure-free, and resilient — ideal for use in disaster zones, offline environments, and sensitive field operations.

---

## Project Goals

- Enable secure, serverless messaging via local device relays (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, UDP)
- Create a propagation model that is self-pruning, resilient, and scalable
- Integrate lightweight peer learning to improve routing decisions over time
- Support future extensions such as group messaging and swarm optimization
- Offer a modular open-source reference for mesh-based communication systems

---

## Key Features

- Fractal message propagation (3-way hops, with up to 5-depth tree spread)
- Encrypted headers and payloads, recipient-only decryption
- Self-deletion of message copies after successful hop or delivery
- Local peer scorecards with optional AI-ready routing intelligence
- Optional aggregators for private swarms (enterprise, research, or tactical)
- Fully offline-capable; runs over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, or LAN-based UDP

---

## Use Cases

- **Disaster zones** – Communication where signal towers are down
- **Military/tactical ops** – Secure field coordination without infrastructure
- **Censorship-resistant environments** – Encrypted, trace-resistant delivery
- **Industrial intranets** – Messaging within ships, factories, hospitals
- **Education & research** – Teaching decentralized systems and AI routing
