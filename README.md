MAMAWMAIL: An AI-Assisted Decentralized Messaging Protocol Using Fractal Propagation

Abstract

MAMAWMAIL is a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging protocol that delivers encrypted messages without central servers or permanent infrastructure. Using a fractal propagation model, messages branch through nearby devices and self-clean upon successful delivery. It integrates lightweight routing intelligence and prepares for optional AI-based learning to optimize delivery paths over time. MAMAWMAIL is designed to be censorship-resistant, infrastructure-free, and suitable for use in disaster zones, offline environments, and sensitive field operations.




Project Goals

Enable secure, serverless messaging using local device relays (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, UDP)

Create a propagation system that is self-pruning, resilient, and scalable

Add lightweight peer learning to improve routing over time

Support future extensions like group messaging and swarm optimization

Provide a modular open-source reference for mesh-based communication systems




Key Features
Fractal message propagation (3-way hops, 5-depth maximum)

Encrypted headers and message payloads

Self-deletion after successful hop or device match

Local peer scorecard and optional routing intelligence

Optional aggregator support for private swarms (enterprise, research, military)

Designed for offline, hostile, or disconnected environments





Use Cases
Disaster zone communication without signal

Military field coordination in disconnected areas

Censorship resistance in restricted networks

Messaging inside factories, ships, or campuses

Educational use for decentralized learning and AI swarm modeling
