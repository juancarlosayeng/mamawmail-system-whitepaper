## 1. Abstract
A concise summary of the motivation, method, results, and implications of MAMAWMAIL and the Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP). Limit to ~200 words.

---

## 2. Introduction
- Problem background: centralized servers, surveillance, and resilience issues in messaging systems.  
- Motivation: why IFPP is needed.  
- Contributions: what this whitepaper proposes.

---

## 3. Related Work and Background
- Survey of existing protocols (SMTP, XMPP, Matrix, IPFS, BitTorrent, etc.).  
- Prior approaches to P2P and decentralized messaging.  
- Limitations of existing systems.

---

## 4. System Overview
- High-level architecture.  
- Core components: Orchestration, Message Architecture, Propagation, Crawler, etc.  
- Design principles (redundancy, fractal spread, no-central-server).

---

## 5. Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP)
- Definition of fractal propagation.  
- Packet lifecycle (build → propagate → confirm → delete).  
- Redundancy and “been here” flag mechanics.  
- Hop limit and propagation singularity.

---

## 6. Mathematical Model
- Delivery assurance formulas.  
- Redundancy growth (3^n propagation).  
- Fractal threshold limits.  
- Graphs/plots of packet spread vs. network size.

---

## 7. Protocol Layers
- **Message Layer**: packet + header structure.  
- **Propagation Layer**: fractal propagation engine.  
- **Crawler Layer**: device discovery and scoring.  
- **Control Layer**: orchestration and monitoring.

---

## 8. Security and Privacy
- End-to-end encryption model.  
- Header vs. payload separation.  
- Temporary vs. persistent storage.  
- Attack resistance (DDoS, replay, poisoning).

---

## 9. Implementation Details
- Prototype (Python, Django, Android).  
- Repository structure.  
- Device relay daemons.  
- Integration with web monitoring.

---

## 10. Evaluation and Simulation
- Testbed setup (simulated devices, hops).  
- Metrics: latency, delivery rate, redundancy overhead.  
- Comparative evaluation with Matrix, IPFS, BitTorrent.  
- Results & analysis.

---

## 11. Use Cases
- Personal secure email/chat.  
- Enterprise relay networks.  
- Emergency / disaster communication.  
- Offline mesh networks.

---

## 12. Limitations and Future Work
- Known challenges (scalability, mobile energy cost).  
- Future extensions (AI-based routing optimization, predictive redundancy reduction).  
- Integration with decentralized identity systems.

---

## 13. Conclusion
- Summary of findings.  
- Significance of IFPP.  
- Next steps for research and development.
